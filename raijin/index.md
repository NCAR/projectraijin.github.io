Project Raijin is an NSF EarthCube-funded effort whose goal is to
enhance the open source analysis and visualization tool landscape
by developing community-owned, sustainable, scalable tools that
facilitate operating on unstructured climate and global weather
data. Working in close collaboration with atmospheric modelers,
we plan to: (1) develop extensible, scalable, open source tools
supporting fundamental analysis and visualization methods capable
of operating directly (without resampling) on unstructured grid
model outputs at global storm resolving resolutions; and (2)
establish an active, vibrant community of user-contributors,
committed to extending our work beyond the scope of this NSF
award, thus helping ensure the long term sustainability of
the project
