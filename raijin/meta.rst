        Project Raijin is an NSF EarthCube-funded effort whose goal is to enhance
        the open source analysis and visualization tool landscape by developing
        community-owned, sustainable, scalable tools that facilitate operating on
        unstructured climate and global weather data. Working in close collaboration with
        atmospheric modelers, we plan to: (1) develop extensible, scalable, open source
        tools supporting fundamental analysis and visualization methods capable of operating
        directly (without resampling) on unstructured grid model outputs at global storm
        resolving resolutions; and (2) establish an active, vibrant community of
        user-contributors, committed to extending our work beyond the scope of this NSF
        award, thus helping ensure the long term sustainability of the project.
