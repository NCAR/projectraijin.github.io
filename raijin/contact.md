# Contact us!

If you have questions or want to share anything with the Project Raijin Team,
please feel free to reach out to us either via email or through our GitHub repositories (We believe
the latter provides open communication that is most beneficial for the community, but we also welcome
email communication).

## Via Email

Reaching us via email is as easy as:

<span class="d-flex justify-content-center py-4">
    <a href="mailto:projectraijin@googlegroups.com" role="button" class="btn btn-light btn-lg">
        Shoot us an email
    </a>
</span>

## Through Github

We would like to provide our readers with the following chart to clarify which repository to go and
whether to use Github Issues or Discussions for specific communications:
