# Project Raijin

Project Raijin is an NSF EarthCube-funded effort whose goal is to enhance the open source analysis and visualization tool landscape by developing community-owned, sustainable, scalable tools that facilitate operating on unstructured climate and global weather data. Working in close collaboration with atmospheric modelers, we plan to: (1) develop extensible, scalable, open source tools supporting fundamental analysis and visualization methods capable of operating directly (without resampling) on unstructured grid model outputs at global storm resolving resolutions; and (2) establish an active, vibrant community of user-contributors, committed to extending our work beyond the scope of this NSF award, thus helping ensure the long term sustainability of the project
